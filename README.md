# dbt Cloud Cancel Running CI Job Runs Action

___

# NOTE: This Github action is now obsolete now that this functionality is avalible nativelty within [dbt Cloud CI Jobs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/continuous-integration#smart-cancellation-of-stale-builds)
- This repo will no longer be updated or supported 

___

This action checks if a [dbt Cloud](https://cloud.getdbt.com) CI job (based on job ID) is running after a new or updated PR commit is made. If there is a job running or there are job runs that are queued - this action will cancel these running and queued runs since they are likely stale as a new commit to the PR has been made. This allows to always have the newest code commit running in the CI job without having to wait for the stale job runs to finish.


Some scenarios where this is useful:
- You have longer running CI jobs in your dbt Cloud project and you don't want new commits to get queued when they are replacing stale code that is still running in a previous CI job
- You have a large team where there is constant commits/PRs against the code base and you always want the latest job to be run without waiting for older jobs to finish

## **Inputs**

### Required Inputs

- `dbt_cloud_token` - dbt Cloud [API token](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/dbt-cloud-api/service-tokens)
- `dbt_cloud_account_id` - dbt Cloud Account ID
- `dbt_cloud_job_id` - dbt Cloud Job ID

### Optional Inputs
- `only_cancel_run_if_commit_is_using_pr_branch` - A flag that can be set to `true` or `false`
  - When this flag is set to `true`, CI jobs will only get cancelled if the branch that the CI job is running off of is the same as the branch the PR is using 
   - Example of using this: If someone kicks off a CI run based off the branch `branch_1` and then someone else kicks off a CI run based on the branch `branch_2` 
      - When this flag is set to `true` the GitHub Action triggered via the PR on `branch_2` **will not** cancel the CI run based on `branch_1`
      - When this flag is set to `false` (or not set at all) the GitHub Action **will** cancel the run based on `branch_1` as it doesn't care if the branch is related to the newest PR or not - the behavior is to always get the lastest CI job running regardless of branch
  - **When this flag is set to `true` it requires that the input `github_pr_number` be configured to `${{ github.event.number }}`**
- `github_pr_number` - The number of the pull request in GitHub, this is used when limiting cancelling of jobs to just a given PR that is being worked on _This is only needed if `only_cancel_run_if_commit_is_using_pr_branch` is set to `true`_
- `dbt_cloud_host` - the URL of the dbt cloud account with, by default `cloud.getdbt.com` is used
- `max_runs` - the number of runs to look back and cancel for a given dbt Cloud job, by default `10` is used
- `only_cancel_queued_starting_run` - A flag that can be set to `true` or `false`
  - When this flag is set to `true`, the action will only cancel dbt Cloud job runs that are in the state `Queued` or `Starting`
  - The purpose of this flag is to prevent the action from cancelling jobs that are already running when a new CI job is kicked off. Some use cases require this as they don't want to cancel a job that is halfway completed
- `cancel_runs_based_on_schema_override` - A flag that can be set to `true` or `false`
  - When this and `only_cancel_run_if_commit_is_using_pr_branch` are both set to `true`, this action will find the associated PR number of existing dbt runs based on their `schema_override`. Specifically it assumes the `schema_override` will be of the form `dbt_cloud_pr_{dbt_cloud_job_id}_{github_pr_number}`, which matches that of dbt Cloud CI.
  - The purpose of this flag is to enable canceling stale CI runs even if they weren't triggered directly by the dbt Cloud <> GitHub integration. For example, teams triggering CI jobs via GitHub Actions (or any other CI/CD tool) can still utilize this action, as long as the `schema_override` parameter is configured properly in the CI job.

It's recommend to pass sensitive variables as GitHub secrets. [Example article on how to use Github Action secrets](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/GitHub-Actions-Secrets-Example-Token-Tutorial)

## **Outputs**
- `cancelled_jobs_flag` - A returned flag that is outputted as `True` if running/queued job runs were cancelled in order to kick off a CI job for the latest commit. Returns `False` if no job runs were running/queued and therefore didn't need to be cancelled.
- `cancelled_dbt_cloud_job_runs` - A list of dbt Cloud run IDs for the given job that were cancelled in order to kick off a CI job for the latest commit. (e.g. `[85660002, 85660002]`). This is useful for logging. 
- `cancelled_dbt_cloud_job_runs_markdown` - Pre-Scripted markdown containing info on the cancelled jobs, can be used in PR comments. Example of a scenario where 4 job runs where cancelled this is the markdown output:
    ```md
    **The following dbt Cloud job runs were cancelled to free up the queue for the new CI job on the current PR:**
    - Run **85519539** was cancelled at **2022-09-29 23:32:44 UTC**, view this run in dbt Cloud [here](https://cloud.getdbt.com/next/deploy/12345/projects/161955/runs/85519539/)
    - Run **85519497** was cancelled at **2022-09-29 23:32:45 UTC**, view this run in dbt Cloud [here](https://cloud.getdbt.com/next/deploy/12345/projects/161955/runs/85519497/)
    - Run **85519494** was cancelled at **2022-09-29 23:32:46 UTC**, view this run in dbt Cloud [here](https://cloud.getdbt.com/next/deploy/12345/projects/161955/runs/85519494/)
    - Run **85519490** was cancelled at **2022-09-29 23:32:46 UTC**, view this run in dbt Cloud [here](https://cloud.getdbt.com/next/deploy/12345/projects/161955/runs/85519490/)
